# NetToolsKit CLI Templates (restored shell)

This directory hosts Handlebars (`.hbs`) templates referenced by the
`ntk-manifest-*.yml` manifests under `.docs/`. The original project did not
keep these templates under source control, so the exact content cannot be
recovered automatically. The files added in this folder are minimal stubs so
the folder exists again and downstream tooling can resolve the paths defined
in the manifests.

> TODO: Replace the stub templates with the real versions you keep locally or
> recreate the logic you need. Each template currently contains just enough
> structure to compile but will need domain-specific details.
